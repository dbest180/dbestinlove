    We met in a comment section nobody remembers — one of us always typing too
    late, the other always reading too early. Ten years, three countries, and
    three years of a pandemic later, we are still choosing each other.

  <p>It started the way the best things do — by accident. A comment, a reply
  nobody was supposed to answer, and then two people in two different time zones
  talking at hours that made no sense to anyone but them.</p>

  <p>What came next was mostly distance. Ten years of it. Three countries. Three
  years where the world stayed home and we stayed apart — not because we had to,
  but because we had already agreed on something better.</p>

  <p>We said it to each other the way you say a vow long before you know that is
  what it is: <em>not yet, but not never.</em></p>

  <p>Somewhere in all that waiting, we stopped being each other's plus one and
  became each other's home. Two flags. One story. And a wedding at the end of
  the longest long distance either of us had ever run.</p>
